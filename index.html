    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>Currently 2nd year student at University Wisconsin Madison enrolled for
      Computer Science with an intention of pursing a PhD following gradution.
      </p>
    <p>Interested in Computer Networks relating to cloud systems, and how we can
      better use personal devices sustainibly such that the computers we use 
      don't get thrown in the landfills quicker, and rather we can have processes
      run outside personal machines to create more sustainble computers. Through
      my personal exploration, the largest issue we face with moving to cloud 
      dependent systems is connectivity. I would love to appraoch that field of
      research to figure out how to make networks more reliable and efficient.</p>
    <p>Also interested in parallel processing in large scale applications...add here
    </p>

    <h2>Passions</h2>
      <p>Teaching the next generations. Through my experience working with other
        students at or below my education level, it has become very rewarding to 
      help people, particularly students, to suceed and leran in higher level 
      topics. I feel rewarded and fufilled in teaching and would love to take on
      TA postiions, and someday become a professor in computer science.</p>
      <p>Sustainibility in all facets of life. We are givin finite resources
        yet I feel that human kind has a infinite source of creativity. I think 
        that all facets of life should be as sustainible as possible such that 
        there is something left for the next generation to use to fuel their 
        creativity.
      </p>
      <p>Rock Climbing. Rock climbing is a way to diconnect for me. I love my 
        desire to learn and do more all the time, but I recognize in myself 
        that while these are always burning questions in my mind I have to 
        fuel myself with a sense of reality, and by connecting with natural 
        world I can live in the moment and know that I am one of 8 billion 
        people and rememerb that theres finite time on earth for me and I 
        better enjoy it while I'm here.
      </p>
